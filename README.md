# CSE-2111-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-

Welcome to the repository for CSE 282 Sessional, focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms. This repository contains all the practical sessional codes developed during the course. The aim of this course is to provide a comprehensive understanding of various data structures and algorithms, their implementation, and their applications in solving real-world problems.

Contents
Sorting Algorithms: Implementations of various sorting techniques such as Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Bubble Sort.
Searching Algorithms: Implementations of search algorithms including Binary Search, Linear Search, and Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for graph traversal.
Linked Lists: Single, double, and circular linked list operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Stacks and Queues: Implementation of stack and queue operations using arrays and linked lists, including applications like expression evaluation.
Trees: Implementation of binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and their operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and balancing.
Graphs: Representation of graphs using adjacency lists and matrices, and implementation of graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm, Kruskal’s algorithm, and Prim’s algorithm.
Hashing: Techniques for implementing hash tables, collision resolution methods, and applications of hashing.
Dynamic Programming: Examples and implementations of dynamic programming techniques to solve problems like the Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence, and others.
